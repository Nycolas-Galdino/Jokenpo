Come and have fun in a simple game developed by me!

-----
## About project 

The project was developed completely using **Python** as the main programming language and **Visual Studio Code** as its interpreter.

## Requirements to play the game
To start running the software, you will need to install python on your device, then you can access the python [official website](python.org) and download the .exe file, repeat the process with [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)... After installation, you can continue with the tutorial.

## How to play

Primeiro, devemos abrir o prompt de comando do seu computador. 

On **Windows**, you can open it using the command `Win + R`, writing the command `cmd` and pressing `Enter`. So, when you open the command prompt, type the following commands:

```
cd c:/

git clone https://github.com/Nycolas-Galdino/Jokenpo.git 
```

> Use the local disk you prefer, by default, it is the local disk C:


On **Linux**, you can open it usint `Ctrl + Alt + T` and type the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nycolas-Galdino/Converter-texto-PDF.git 
```


If everything goes correctly, a folder called `Jokenpo` will be created on your disk.
So, wait for the project to finish downloading and, in the meantime, go grab a cup of coffee and relax! Generally the download is fast, but the download time may vary depending on your internet availability!

After installing the project, run the following command in your terminal (remembering that we are using Windows as an example):


```
cd C:/Jokenpo

python main.py
```
